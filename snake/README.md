1/26/2020 - so far I have created an application that allows the user to play the basic game of snake. The program can keep score, restart, and detect a loss.
            my next step is to create a highscore system and then implement that into a server database of my own.

I updated the theme of my snake game to 'space', I've created a space background and updated the way the 'food' and the play looks on the screen

I also updated the Html/CSS to look a lot better

after working on creating apis of my own and connecting them frontend pages I am ready to start adding a highscore system for my game that will store highscores on my Mongo-Database

2/23/20

setup schema model and set up index with a route handler that is being imported from the routes folder.
all together these will be the key components to sending and recieving highscore information to an from my Mongo Database
